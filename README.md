# REPO for testing out and learning git commands

This repo would contain a comprehensive guide to setup git and make commits to the repo online.

**Note:** Some of the commands which I use in the guide might not be correct or not upto what an expert in git would do. Any suggestions and corrections would be helpful

Also all of the files and branches were created and uploaded using git and the webui.
